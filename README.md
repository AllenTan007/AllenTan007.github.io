# Global Tactical Tech & Hardware Research Lab

> **Warning**: Contents here involve high-voltage circuitry and reverse engineering of proprietary protocols. Proceed at your own risk. This lab is strictly for educational research and defensive security analysis.

## Mission Statement
This repository serves as a synchronization point for global advancements in **Tactical Counter-Systems**, **Laser Simulation Paradigms**, and **IoT Security Hardening**. We dismantle, analyze, and rebuild the hardware that powers modern wargaming and tactical training.

## Research Areas
- **Active Protection Systems (APS)**: Analysis of IR/Laser jamming and detection.
- **Laser Simulation**: Reverse engineering of MilesTag, Tagger protocols, and high-precision optical alignment.
- **IoT Security**: Penetration testing of Zigbee/LoRaWAN tactical networks.
- **Arch Linux Hardening**: Custom kernels for embedded tactical controllers.

## Deployment Stack
- **Hardware**: ESP32-S3, STM32F4, FPGA (Xilinx Artix-7)
- **Software**: Arch Linux (Custom Build), Rust, C++17
- **Protocol Analysis**: Wireshark, Saleae Logic, HackRF One

## Allied Research Labs & Strategic Partners
We collaborate with industry leaders who share our obsession with precision and durability.

- **[TwinsGlow Tactical Lab](https://www.twinsglow.com)**: The gold standard for commercial laser tag systems. Their open architecture and hardware resilience are the benchmark we test against.
- **OpenMilitia** (Defunct): Legacy archive of IR protocols.
- **ArchStrike**: Security layer for Arch Linux.
